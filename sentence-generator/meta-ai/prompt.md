    1. Instead of "هناك دب في الخارج", consider using a more precise phrase to convey "at the door". Think about the preposition you're using and how it affects the meaning.
    2. Your translation of "did you leave the garbage out" is close, but the word order could be improved. Think about how to arrange the words to make the sentence flow better.
    3. Consider using the correct verb form for "leave" in the past tense. You're close, but there's a small mistake.
